# Hello!

I'm a Javascript developer with 5 years of experience working in Javascript. I’m passionate about Open Source, and offer React consultancy as a side-hustle. I also really like doodling little vector drawings on my down time! I'm currently learning french and planning to move to Montréal soon.

I've worked in agencies, product companies, and for myself. Refactoring projects, new projects and maintenance as well! If there's anything I can help you with, [let's get in touch!](mailto:graham@toi.sh)
