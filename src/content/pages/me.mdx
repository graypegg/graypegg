# Hello!

I'm a <Annotated icon="hi">Javascript developer</Annotated> with <Emphasis>5 years of experience</Emphasis> working in Javascript. I’m passionate about Open Source, and offer React consultancy as a side-hustle. I also really like doodling little vector drawings on my <Annotated icon="coffee">down time!</Annotated> I'm currently learning french and planning to move to Montréal soon. When the weather is right, I love <Annotated icon="bike">cycling</Annotated> as well!

I've worked in agencies, product companies, and for myself. Refactoring projects, new projects and maintenance as well! If there's anything I can help you with, [let's get in touch!](mailto:graham@toi.sh)
