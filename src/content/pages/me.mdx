# <Rainbow>Hello!</Rainbow>

I'm a <Annotated icon="hi">Javascript+Typescript developer</Annotated> with <Emphasis><Jumping>5 years of experience</Jumping></Emphasis> working on the web. I’m passionate about Open Source, and offer React consultancy as a side-hustle. I also really like doodling little vector drawings on my <Annotated icon="coffee">down time!</Annotated> I'm currently learning french and planning to move to <Annotated icon="montreal">Montréal</Annotated> soon. When the weather is right, I love <Annotated icon="bike">cycling</Annotated> as well!

I've worked in agencies, product companies, and for myself. I've worked on refactoring projects, new projects and maintenance as well! So <Annotated icon="info">[let's get in touch!](mailto:me@graypegg.com)</Annotated>

<small lang="fr">Petit note: Je suis aussi capable de parler avec vous <Emphasis>en français!</Emphasis></small>
