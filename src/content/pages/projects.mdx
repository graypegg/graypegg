# Projects

I live most of my life in [<Annotated icon="omnifocus">omnifocus</Annotated>](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) so I end up dividing most of the things I want to do into projects. Here's a short list of what I currently have in progress-ish to keep me honest.

## Side things
Keeping myself busy with a combintation of useful things (20%) and <Rainbow>dumb things</Rainbow> (80%).
