# Projects

I live most of my life in [<Annotated icon="omnifocus">omnifocus</Annotated>](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) so I end up dividing most of the things I want to do into projects. Here's a short list of what I currently have in progress-ish to keep me honest.

| Name | Status | Active |
|-|-|-|
| <Link to="/posts/omnifocus-timer">Omnifocus Timer</Link> | Done | Yes |
| Messing around with Nova Extensions | Doing it | Yes |
| **Post:** Web Components for bridging the gap between FE framworks. | Trying to write | No |
