# Projects

I live most of my life in [<Annotated icon="omnifocus">omnifocus</Annotated>](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) so I end up dividing most of the things I want to do into projects. Here's a short list of what I currently have in progress-ish to keep me honest.

## Side things
Keeping myself busy with a combintation of useful things (20%) and <Rainbow>dumb things</Rainbow> (80%).

| Messing around with Nova Extensions | Doing it | Yes |

## Moving to Montreal
People ask me what up with my move approximately <Jumping>10 billion times a day,</Jumping> so I'll link you here if you ask. Hopefully that doesn't seem passive-agressive. (It's not supposed to be obvious.)
