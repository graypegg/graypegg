Have you used Web Components before? There's a good chance you haven't. The usual suspects (React, Vue, Angular, etc.) allow us to work with a flavour of the UI component pattern without actually using the native Web Component standard, since up until now, there really hasn't been the browser support to justify it.

```typescript
const foo = bar
interface cat {
  meow: () => string
}
function isCat(maybeCat: Object) maybeCat is cat {
  return 'meow' in maybeCat;
}
console.log(foo);
```
